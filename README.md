# Design - UI Accessibility

This is my assignment for Module 3 Design - UI Accessibility

- Go to [the guide](https://io.tskoli.dev/guides/61447cd178de2900086b1e9e)

- Go to [my website](https://tristan-sch.github.io/hello-accessibility/)

- Go to [my Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/EjWSDoWUnmLArsZUi1Zql2/Design---UI-Accessibility?node-id=0%3A1)

## What did I do?

1. I created a very simple **HTML page** structured to the Accessibility guidelines and included a brief report about Universal design vs. a Inclusive Design and included it in the HTML page

2. I created a **Figma prototype** showcasing accessibility requirements

## 1. HTML Page

Pretty simple and self-explanatory, I used Role attributes and Aria labels. **Check out the comments in the HTML file.**

For the Article, I gathered some info I found online on these articles:

- [Inclusive Design vs. Universal Design: Whatâ€™s the Difference?](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/universal-vs-inclusive-design/)

- [Design That Benefits Everyone: Top 5 Inclusive Design Examples](https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/design-that-benefits-everyone-top-5-inclusive-design-examples)

## 2. Figma prototype

For this I wanted to take a practical example:

- I took the page I am creating for the travel agency I work for, **AD Travel**

- I used the plugin [A11y - Focus Orderer ](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731310036968334777/A11y---Focus-Orderer) for the Screen 1 with two sequences, one for the navigation and one for the hero section

- I used the plugin [Stark](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/732603254453395948/Stark) to test my buttons. As you can see, I did not pass and I created "right" layouts for the buttons so they have the "right" contrast ratios. The thing is, by doing so the colors change and I am not happy with it. I would very much like to discuss this further and find a solution! :)
